        <p><strong>Adolf Hitler</strong> (German: [ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ] (About this sound listen); 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) 
        was a German politician, demagogue,[1] Pan-German revolutionary, [2][3] 
        and leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP)
        who rose to power in Germany as Chancellor in 1933 and Führer ("Leader") in 1934.[a] 
        As dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, he initiated World War II in Europe 
        by invading Poland in September 1939, 
        and was central to the perpetration of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" target="_blank">the Holocaust.</a></p>
        <p>
           Germany implemented the persecution in stages. Following Adolf Hitler's rise to power
            in 1933, the government passed laws to exclude
            Jews from civil society, most prominently the Nuremberg Laws in 1935. 
            Starting in 1933, the Nazis built a network of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps" target="_blank">concentration camps</a>
            in Germany for political opponents and people 
            deemed "undesirable". After the invasion of Poland in 1939, the regime set 
            up ghettos to segregate Jews. Over 42,000 camps, ghettos, and other 
            detention sites were established.[8]

            By 1933, the Nazi Party was the largest elected party 
            in the German Reichstag, but did not have a majority, 
            and no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in 
            support of a candidate for chancellor. Former chancellor Franz von 
            Papen and other conservative leaders persuaded President Paul von 
            Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. 
            Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933, 
            which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, 
            a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic 
            ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from 
            Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the 
            injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated 
            by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in 
            rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation 
            of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I and the annexation of territories 
            inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which gave him significant popular support.

            Hitler sought Lebensraum ("living space") for the German people in 
            Eastern Europe and his aggressive foreign policy is considered the 
            primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale 
            rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in 
            Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, 
            Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, 
            German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of 
            Europe and North Africa. In December 1941, he declared war on 
            the United States, bringing them directly into the conflict. 
            Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States 
            into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a 
            series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during 
            the Battle of Berlin in 1945, he married his longtime lover Eva Braun. 
            Less than two days later on 30 April 1945, the two committed suicide to 
            avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army and their corpses were burned.

            Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, 
            the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 
            5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and 
            his followers deemed Untermenschen (subhumans) or socially 
            undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible 
            for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and 
            prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and 
            civilians died as a result of military action in the European 
            theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II 
            was unprecedented in warfare and the casualties constitute 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll" target="_blank">
                the deadliest conflict in history.
